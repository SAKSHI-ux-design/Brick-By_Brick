🧱 Brick by Brick – Predicting Real Estate Prices with Data Analytics
This repository contains the field project work carried out as part of my MBA curriculum. The primary objective of this project is to analyze real estate data and build predictive models to estimate housing prices using Machine Learning techniques in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

📌 Project Overview
Title: Brick by Brick – Predicting Real Estate Prices with Data Analytics

Objective: To develop a predictive model that accurately estimates property prices based on historical housing data.

Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest

Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset (sourced from Kaggle)

Focus: Data-driven insights for buyers, sellers, investors, and policy planners.

🧠 Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify influential features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding)

Correlation and feature importance analysis

Building and training machine learning models

Model evaluation using R² Score, MAE, RMSE

Interpretation of findings and insights for decision-making

📊 Tools & Libraries
Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Insights Generated
Location, number of rooms, crime rate, and property tax were top price influencers

Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in predictive accuracy

Identified gaps in market understanding through user survey insights
